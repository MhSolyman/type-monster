    <h3><b> Q1: What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</b></h3>
    <p><b>Ans:</b> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while <br>
        data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when <br>
        the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the <br>
        browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab. <br>
        Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session <br>
        storage data gets cleared when the user closes its browser</p>
    <h3><b>Q2: What is the difference between local scope and global scope?</b></h3>
    <p><b>Ans:</b> A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from <br>
        anywhere in the code. Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside
        <br> code blocks. A local variable has local scope.
        <br>JavaScript variables have only two scopes. Global Variables − A global variable <br>
        has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code. <br>
        Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where <br>
        it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Q3: How JavaScript Event Loop Work?</b></h3>
    <p><b>Ans:</b> The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback <br>
        Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from <br>
        the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such <br>
        an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop</p>
    <h3><b>Q4: How to get undefined ?</b></h3>
    <p> <b>Ans: </b>In a JavaScript program, the correct way to check if an object property <br>
        is undefined is to use the `typeof` operator. See how you can use it with <br>
        this simple explanation. In a JavaScript program, the correct way to check <br>
        if an object property is undefined is to use the typeof operator. <br>
        Undefined value primitive value is used when a variable has not been <br>
        assigned a value. The standard clearly defines that you will receive <br>
        undefined when accessing uninitialized variables, non-existing object <br>
        properties, non-existing array elements, and alike.</p>
